config SUNXI_BUDGET_COOLING
	tristate "sunxi budget cooling"
	depends on ARCH_SUNXI
	help
	  Adds sunxi cpu budget cooling devices, and these cooling devices can be
	  bound to thermal zone trip points. When a trip point reached, the
	  bound cpufreq cooling device turns active to set CPU frequency low to
	  cool down the CPU.

config SUNXI_BUDGET_COOLING_CPU_DVFS
	tristate "sunxi budget cooling about CPU-DVFS"
	depends on THERMAL_OF
	depends on CPU_FREQ
	depends on SUNXI_BUDGET_COOLING
	help
	  Adds CPU cooling device about CPU dynamic-voltage-frequence-scaling.

config SUNXI_BUDGET_COOLING_HOTPLUG
	tristate "sunxi budget cooling about Hotplug"
	depends on THERMAL_OF
	depends on HOTPLUG_CPU
	depends on SUNXI_BUDGET_COOLING
	help
	  Adds CPU cooling device use hotplug limit.

config SUNXI_BUDGET_COOLING_GPU_FS
	tristate "sunxi budget cooling about GPU FS"
	depends on THERMAL_OF
	depends on SUNXI_BUDGET_COOLING
	help
	  Adds sunxi gpu cooling devices, and these cooling devices can be
	  bound to thermal zone trip points. When a trip point reached, the
	  gpu cooling device turns active to set gpu frequency low to
	  cool down the CPU.

config SUNXI_BUDGET_COOLING_FREQTBL
	tristate "sunxi cpu budget cooling parse VF table support"
	depends on SUNXI_BUDGET_COOLING
	depends on ARCH_SUN8IW6
	help
	Add sunxi budget cooling frequecy tables.Get cpu frequency tables from
	cpu policy.Cpu budget cooling do not define fixed cpu frequecy point,just
	get these frequecy point from opp or dvfs_tables
